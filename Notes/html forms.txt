HTML FORMS



WEB FORMS:

One of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application
Forms allows users to enter data which is the generally sent to server for processing and storage or used on the client-side
to immediately update the interface in some way



THE FORM ELEMENT

All forms start with a <form> element, like this:

	<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="POST">

	</form>

This element defines a form. It's a container element like a <section> or <footer> element.
It supports some specific attributes, the standard is to always set atleast *action* and *method* attributes
- The *action* attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent
- The *method* attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post)



INSIDE FORM ELEMENT

Here are a few simple things to put inside a form element
We want a form where you can say what your name, email and message is and then to send it

First you want the <form> element and inside that you want <ul> elements to contain <li> elements where inside those you put
your actual elements, we are using list since it will structure our code nicely and make styling easier.

When making the elements for the text fields first you want a <label> form and structure it like this for name field:
	<label for="name">Name:</label>
We use the attribute FOR to take value from a later specified ID attribute on the <input> element that we discuss below,
this is how you associate a form control with its label. When you have both id and the for elements specified as the same,
when a person clicks on the <label> it makes them control the <input>

When making the next element for the name label you want it to look like this:
	<input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
