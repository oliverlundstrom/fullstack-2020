CSS

You have your HTML code in a folder, in that folder make another folder and name it styles, inside that make a style.css file
to make css code work on html you need to apply CSS to your HTML document thus:
paste <link href="styles/style.css" ref="stylesheet"> into your HTML head


ANATOMY OF A CSS RULESET

in:

	p {
	  color: red;
	}

SELECTOR
the "p" is the selector, this could be a html class to control certain paragraphs etc.
in this instance it takes all <p> elements to be styled upon

DECLARATION
it is a single rule like in this instance "color: red;" which determines 
which of the elements properties you want to style

PROPERTIES
It is a way in which you can style an HTML element, in this instance it is the "color" property of the <p> elements

PROPERTY VALUE
It chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property, in this instance it colors the paragraph "red"



CSS RULESET RULES

- apart from the SELECTOR, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. {}
- within each declaration, you must use a colon : to separate the PROPERTY from its value or values
- within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon ; to separate eachh declaration from the next one

to modify multiple PROPERTY VALUES in one ruleset, write them seperated by semicolons like this:

	p {
		color: red;
		width: 500px;
		border: 1px solid black;
	}



you can also select multiple SELECTORS and apply a single ruleset to all of them:

	p, li, h1 {
		color: red;
	}



DIFFERENT TYPES OF SELECTORS


ELEMENT SELECTOR (sometimes called a tag or type selector)
- All HTML elements of the specified type. 
	(p selects <p>)

ID SELECTOR
- The element on the page with the specified ID. Every ID value should be unique on a given HTML page 
	(#my-id selects 
		<p id="my-id"> 
		     or 
		<a id="my-id">
	)

CLASS SELECTOR
- The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on the same page
	(.my-class selects
		<p class="my-class">
		       and
		<a class="my-class">
	)

ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR
- The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute
	(img[src] selects
		<img src="myimage.png">
		       but not
		<img>
	)

PSEUDO CLASS SELECTOR
- The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (for example, when a cursor hovers over a link)
	(a:hover selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link)
