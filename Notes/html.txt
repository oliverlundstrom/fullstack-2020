HTML



ELEMENTS
<p>Bruh<\p>
the <p><\p>'s are tags that make the whole element a paragraph
"bruh" is the content of the element, being only string this instance.


<p class="bruh">bruh<\p>
now this element has a class, and if we want to make changes to its style we can target it and others with the
class "bruh" at the same time.



NESTED ELEMENTS
we can also nest elements
by putting elements insinde elements like so:

<p>im <strong> BRUHHING <\strong> right now <\p>

this would make the "bruhhing" emphasized strongly.
You do need to make sure that the elements are properly nested, this wont do:

<p>im <strong> BRUHHING right now <\p> <\strong>



EMPTY ELEMENTS
Some elements have no content (or "bruh" in this instance) and are thus empty, like the <img> element

<img src="link_here" alt="cool picture">

this contains two attributes but there is no closing <\img> tag and no inner content. This is because
the element doesnt have content so it doesnt need to close itself



THE ANATOMY OF HTML DOCUMENTS

first you need an 
	<!DOCTYPE html> 
because it makes sure that the document behaves correctly

After that everything else is "content" inside a 
	<html><\html> 
element that wraps around everything

This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the 
HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. 
	<head></head>
This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, 
CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.

Then still inside the head element is usually
	<meta charset="utf-8">
which sets the character set to utf-8

After that there is usually a
	<title><\title>
element which sets the title of your page aka the things you see on the chrome tab

AFTER ALL THAT we get to the
	<body><\body>
element, which contains all the content that you want to show on your page.
It could include a lot of different things.



INSIDE <BODY><\BODY> ELEMENT
<img src="link"> - displays an image from the link, could include an attribute to show text instead or hovering over it
<h1><\h1> - displays headings which are basically main titles, chapter titles etc. has different styles <h1>-<h6>
<p><\p> - displays paragraphs of text and is usually used to mark up text content
<a><\a> - displays a link, you can put content as the text shown and use <a href="link"> to make it a link
	Lists
<ul><\ul> - displays an unordered list where the order does not matter
<ol><\ol> - displays an ordered list where the order does matter
<li><\li> - is put inside the ul or ol lists as elements of the list
